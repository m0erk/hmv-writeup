Driftingblues is the Name of the CTF.
1: nmap die target - only port 80 is open. 
2: using nikto to fetch some information on the webpage. Looked not so promising but there seems to be a readable "robots.txt"
3: Check the content of robots.txt
4: Robots contains a hint, I should include .zip extension in my dir-enumeration. 
5: Dir-enumeration with gobuster including .zip
6: Found spammer.zip on server plus a textpattern instance on /textpattern/
7: Downloaded spammer.zip and found it was pw-protected. -> zip2john -> john to crack the pw. Unzip with the found pw. 
8: creds.txt was found in the .zip file with a user:pass combination (assuming for textpattern login). 
9: checked the textpattern version v4.8 -> searched for exploit on exploit-db.com and found a RCE with a webshell. 
10: executed the exploit by using the found credentials and got access via webshell -> webshell to reverse shell via nc. 
11: download of lineas.sh to the target and ./linpeas.sh -> showed highly probable vektor via cirtycow exploit (kernel v2.6 - v3.3 or so). 
12: download and compiling of the mentioned exploit -> got root. 

Very nice CTF with real-life vulnerable stuff.. very straight forward, LEVEL: easy.
