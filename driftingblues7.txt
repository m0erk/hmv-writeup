Next driftingblues VM Machine from HackMyVM.eu

1: nmap target -sV -p
2: Fount open ports 66,80,443,... some more. 
3: gobuster enumeration port 80 -> no real success.
4: gobuster enumeration port 66 -> found user.txt / root.txt readable via CURL. -> CTF done.

5: found folger "eon" with a base64 encoded .zip file.
6: used john to bruteforce the zip
7: found admin credentials for EON
8: logged into EON with found creds
9: searched for used version and according exploits
10: msfconsole found exploit for this EOS with active admin session
11: startet this exploit and ended with a root reverse shell


Nice VM but strange to have direct access to user.txt and root.txt flag
